# Spring React Authentication Demo
This is a demo project for Spring Boot + ReactJS + Session based authentication. This is to show how to implement spring security 6, and storing csrf token in session cookies when authenticating user.

# Project Structure

The project is divided into 3 parts: the front-end, the back-end, and tests. The front-end is built using ReactJS, and the back-end is built using Spring Boot. The front-end is served from the back-end server. The front-end is located at [src/frontend](src/frontend/react-typescript), and the back-end is located at [src/main](src/main).

here's what the project structure looks like when you open the src folder:
## Backend

# Features
* Login
* Registration
* Delete user
* Spring Security 6 with session based authentication and CSRF protection

# Prerequisites
* [Java 17.0.8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
* [Docker (latest version)](https://www.docker.com)
* [Intellij IDEA (or your favorite IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)
* [Node 14.17.2 or LTS](https://nodejs.org/en)

# Getting Started

This section teaches how to install, run and test the application.

## Installation

1. After cloning the project, change directory into the project directory `spring-react-auth-demo`, and run the command. Make sure you have docker installed and running.
* ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```
2. After waiting for the docker container to set up. run the command
* ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```
3. After waiting for the build to finish, run the application from the main class [AuthApplication.java](src/main/java/uy/anthony/auth/AuthApplication.java). The frontend will be served from the backend server. No need to run dev server for the frontend. You can go to [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181) to see the application running.
   You should then be seeing this page:
    ![login page](img/login-page.png)

## Testing

To test whether csrf protection is on. You can go to [index.http](./index.http) file at the root directory of the project and run a request. If the request is forbidden, then csrf protection is working. If not, then csrf protection is not working. If you want the request to proceed, disable the csrf protection at the security config of the app.
You can also check [health](localhost:8181/actuator/health) of the application when it's running.

# Packaging
1. To package the application, run the command
* ```sh
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```
2. Wait for the build to finish, then run the command (make sure the postgres container in docker is running)
* ```sh
    java -jar target/spring-react-auth-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
    This will run the application in production mode with the front-end bundled in the jar file.
